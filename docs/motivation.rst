TODO

The motivation behind this project is to **speed up** the process of creating a bot in python using only the GUI
ie the pixels of the screen, the mouse and the keyboard.
It can be quite cumbersome to extract the right information from the screen or make some GUI actions like clicking
on a specific screen position.
This library's goal is to ease this part so as to let the focus be on other aspects of creating bots like the AI.

Making a bot from GUI can sometimes feel somewhat hacky or unstable because it revolves in finding some unique
enough patterns on screen and along the specificities of the subject of the bot.
On the other side they are general enough to be used for many projects as long as the performance needs are not too high.
This library aims to speed up the process of **finding, registering and testing patterns**.
